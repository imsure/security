UNDERGRADUATE,MASTERS,PHD (U/M/P):	P
PROBLEM (1/2):	1
TOOLS:		emacs, bash, od, diff, gcc
TECHNIQUES:	I simply use emacs to look through the code. Print out the variable values
		which I am interested in and write comments in the obfuscated source code to 
		remind myself. I follow the execution sequence of the code and idenfity those 
		true/false opaque predicates. After figuring out what code does, I write the
		de-obfuscated code with idiomatic C. I also test the results with a shell script
		by feeding executables with random numbers.
TIME:		4 hours
DIFFICULTY:	easy
CHALLENGES:	navigating through code, identifying the purpose for varibles and how their values change.
COMMENTS:	I enjoyed this assignment! It takes patience too navigate through the code to fingure
		out what it is doing. It also helps me realize that simple obfuscation techniques cannot
		prevent code from de-obfuscating very well.
